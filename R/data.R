"returns_donor_details"

#' Detailed receipts
#'
#' Itemised details of receipts from annual returns of parties, political
#' campaigners and associated entities.
#'
#' Part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 requires all political
#' parties, political campaigners and associated entities to set out the details
#' of all receipts above the disclosure threshold each financial year.
#'
#' These details set out:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'
#' \item{the name of the person/entity that provided the funds}
#'
#' \item{the address of the person/entity}
#'
#' \item{the amount received from that person/entity}
#'
#' \item{the type of funds that were received}
#'
#' }
#'
#' The details of the following returns are found in this dataset (as per
#' \code{ReturnTypeDescription}):
#'
#' \itemize{
#'
#' \item{"Third Party Return"}
#'
#' \item{"Significant Third Party Return"}
#'
#' \item{"Political Party Return"}
#'
#' \item{"Organisation Donor Return"}
#'
#' \item{"Member of HOR Return"}
#'
#' \item{"Associated Entity Return"}
#'
#' \item{"Political Campaigner Return"}
#'
#' \item{"Individual Donor Return"}
#'
#' }
#'
#' All detailed receipts disclosed on political party, political campaigner and
#' associated entity returns from 1998-99 onwards are listed.
#'
#' Receipts may be listed in \code{ReceiptType} as donations ("Donation
#' Received") or as an "Other Receipt". Occasionally \code{ReceiptType} is
#' listed as a "Subscription", which are treated by the AEC (and the \emph{CEA})
#' as Other Receipts. Additionally, there is a \code{ReceiptType} of "Third
#' Party Gift", but these are only present in third party returns
#' (\link{returns_thirdparty}).
#'
#' There are around 125 rows where \code{ReceiptType} is blank in the original
#' AEC data, but most of them are older and most are not political party returns
#' and it is probably reasonably safe (and consistent with AEC practice) to
#' consider these to be donations. These blank rows have been converted to
#' "Unspecified" in the data import script.
#'
#' A derived logical variable \code{IsPublicFunding} is also included. This is a
#' reasonable guestimate of whether an other receipt is public funding from a
#' state or territory electoral commission (government grants to parties are not
#' included here). Use this variable in preference over \code{ReceiptType} of
#' "Public Funding", which appears problematic in the data.

#'   in preference) (Chr).}
#'
#'   \item{TransactionDate}{Date object of transaction date (Date). Note that a
