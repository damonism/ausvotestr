\description{
AEC-provided addresses for the donors listed in the \code{returns_donor} file.
}
\details{
The AEC provides CSV files with the addresses of donors who have made
returns, however because those records in the CSV files do not have unique
identifiers it is not possible to definitively match the addresses to the
records in the \code{returns_donor} data.

As of the 2018-19 data, matching on \code{c("FinancialYear",
"CurrentClientName", "TotalDonationsReceived"))} duplicates about 40-odd
records (or about 11,000), which may be sufficient precision, depending on
what you want to do.

The formatting of donors from outside Australia is inconsistent, but they
can generally be picked up by filter on \code{is.na(Postcode)}.
