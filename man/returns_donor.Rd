\description{
List of annual returns from political donors (1998-99 to 2020-21),
}
\details{
During the period covered by this data the reporting requirements in the
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 changed, which led to the discrepancy
between the \code{TotalDonationsMadeToPoliticalPartiesAndCampaigners} and
\code{TotalDonationsMadeToPoliticalParties} variables.
