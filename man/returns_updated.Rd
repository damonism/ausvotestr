This data is automatically generated each time the data is extracted.

Note that the new returns data is only released on the first working day
of February for the previous financial year, however amendments may be made
to returns in the meantime. Data extracted after early February should
therefore generally not contain new returns, but may have some different
entries to the original data release.
