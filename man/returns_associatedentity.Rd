\href{https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/financial_disclosure/guides/associated-entities/index.htm}{According
to the AEC} persons or entities are required to register as an associated
entity if any of the following apply in a financial year:

\itemize{

\item{the entity is controlled by one or more registered political parties;}

\item{the entity is a financial member of a registered political party;}

\item{another person is a financial member of a registered political party on
behalf of the entity;}

\item{the entity has voting rights in a registered political party;}

\item{another person has voting rights in a registered political party on
behalf of the entity;}

\item{the entity operates wholly, or to a significant extent, for the benefit
of one or more disclosure entities, and the benefit relates to one or more
electoral activities (whether or not the electoral activities are undertaken
during an election period).}

}

Examples of associated entities include '500 clubs', 'think tanks',
registered clubs, service companies, trade unions and corporate party
members.

Data is by financial year and is published by the AEC at the beginning of the
February following the financial year.

Note that the data have been taken directly from AEC website and thus contain
the AEC's idiosyncrasies and very occasional errors.
