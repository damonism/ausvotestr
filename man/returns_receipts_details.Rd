\format{
A \code{data.frame} with 20 variables:

\describe{

\item{ViewName}{String of "Annual Detailed Receipt" (Chr).}

\item{RegistrationCode}{Unique code for each individual return (Chr).}

\item{ReturnId}{Unique code for each individual return (Int) -- It is not
clear why both this and \code{RegistrationCode} both exist but may be for
internal AEC use.}

\item{ReturnTypeCode}{String of one of "federalthirdparty",
"federalsignificantthirdparty", "federalpoliticalparty",
"federaldonororganisation", "federalmemberofhor",
"federalassociatedentity", "federalpoliticalcampaigner" or
"federaldonorindividual" (Chr).}

\item{ReturnTypeDescription}{String of one of "Third Party Return",
"Significant Third Party Return", "Political Party Return", "Organisation
Donor Return", "Member of HOR Return", "Associated Entity Return",
"Political Campaigner Return" or "Individual Donor Return" (Chr).}

\item{AmendmentNumber}{The number of times the return has been amended
(Int).}

\item{UniqueReferenceNumber}{Unique code (as per \code{RegistrationCode})
for each amendment of each return (Chr).}

\item{RecipientClientId}{Unique identifier (\code{ClientFileId} of the
recipient of the donation (Int).}

\item{RecipientName}{Name of the receipient of the money (Chr).}

\item{RecipientClientType}{One of "Political Party", "Political
Campaigner", "Third Party", "Organisation Donor" or "Associated Entity"
(Chr).}

\item{PartyGroupId}{ID if party is a member of a party group (see
\code{\link{party_by_group}}) (Int).}

\item{PoliticalPartyId}{List of IDs of political parties (List).}

\item{ReceivedFromClientName}{Name that the donor (Chr).}

\item{RecivedFromClientId}{\code{ClientFileId} of the donor (Int).}

\item{RecieptType}{One of "Donation Received", "Other Receipt",
"Subscription", "Unspecified", "Third Party Gift" (only for third party
returns) or "Public Funding" (note that "Public Funding" here does not seem
to be very reliable, and is only in old data - use \code{IsPublicFunding}
in preference) (Chr).}

\item{TransactionDate}{Date object of transaction date (Date). Note that a
large proportion of entries \strong{do not include a date} (ie., the data
will be \code{NA}), and filtering by date will therefore exclude a large
amount of data.}

\item{Amount}{Donation amount in whole Australian dollars (Int).}

\item{PartyGroupName}{If party is a member of a party group, the name of
the group (see \code{\link{party_by_group}}) (Chr).}

\item{FinancialYear}{Financial year of the return in the format of
\code{YYYY-YY}.}

\item{DisclosurePeriodEndDate}{End date of the financial year as a date
object (easier to use for plotting) (Date).}

\item{IsPublicFunding}{Derived variable indicating whether the amount is
public election funding from an electoral commission (federal or state or
territory). This is a guestimate, but probably a pretty accurate one
(Logical).}

\description{
Itemised details of receipts from annual returns of parties, political
campaigners and associated entities.
}
\details{
Part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 requires all political
parties, political campaigners and associated entities to set out the details
of all receipts above the disclosure threshold each financial year.

These details set out:

\itemize{

\item{the name of the person/entity that provided the funds}

\item{the address of the person/entity}

\item{the amount received from that person/entity}

\item{the type of funds that were received}

}

The details of the following returns are found in this dataset (as per
\code{ReturnTypeDescription}):

\itemize{

\item{"Third Party Return"}

\item{"Significant Third Party Return"}

\item{"Political Party Return"}

\item{"Organisation Donor Return"}

\item{"Member of HOR Return"}

\item{"Associated Entity Return"}

\item{"Political Campaigner Return"}

\item{"Individual Donor Return"}

}

All detailed receipts disclosed on political party, political campaigner and
associated entity returns from 1998-99 onwards are listed.

Receipts may be listed in \code{ReceiptType} as donations ("Donation
Received") or as an "Other Receipt". Occasionally \code{ReceiptType} is
listed as a "Subscription", which are treated by the AEC (and the \emph{CEA})
as Other Receipts. Additionally, there is a \code{ReceiptType} of "Third
Party Gift", but these are only present in third party returns
(\link{returns_thirdparty}).

There are around 125 rows where \code{ReceiptType} is blank in the original
AEC data, but most of them are older and most are not political party returns
and it is probably reasonably safe (and consistent with AEC practice) to
consider these to be donations. These blank rows have been converted to
"Unspecified" in the data import script.

A derived logical variable \code{IsPublicFunding} is also included. This is a
reasonable guestimate of whether an other receipt is public funding from a
state or territory electoral commission (government grants to parties are not
included here). Use this variable in preference over \code{ReceiptType} of
"Public Funding", which appears problematic in the data.
