\description{
Itemised details of receipts from annual returns of parties, political
campaigners and associated entities.
}
\details{
Part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 requires all political
parties, political campaigners and associated entities to set out the
details of all receipts above the disclosure threshold each financial
year.

These details set out:
\itemize{
\item the name of the person/entity that provided the funds
\item the address of the person/entity
\item the amount received from that person/entity
\item the type of funds that were received
}

All detailed receipts disclosed on political party, political campaigner
and associated entity returns from 1998-99 onwards are listed.

Returns may be listed as donations ("Donation Received") or as an "Other
Receipt". While there are other types listed in \code{ReceiptType} these
are either a historical anomaly or an error.
