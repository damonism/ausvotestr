\description{
Annual returns from significant third parties (from the 2018-19 to the
2021-22 financial years.)
}
\details{
Part XX of the
\href{https://www.legislation.gov.au/Latest/C2019C00103}{Commonwealth
Electoral Act 1918} requires all registered significant third partied to
lodge financial disclosure returns on an annual basis. Significant third
parties were previously called political campaigners, however the name was
changed in the legislation. The name of the data reflects the name of the
category when it was first introduced into the legislation so as not to break
any existing usage.

These returns set out for that financial year:

\itemize{

\item{the total value of receipts}

\item{the details of amounts received that are more than the disclosure
threshold}

\item{the total value of payments}

\item{the total value of debts as at 30 June}

\item{the details of debts outstanding as at 30 June that total more than the
disclosure threshold}

\item{the total amount of electoral expenditure incurred}

\item{the details of any discretionary benefits received from the
Commonwealth, State or Territory.}

}

Political campaigners were first required to lodge returns for the 2018-19
financial year and all lodged returns are listed.
