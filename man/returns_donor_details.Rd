\format{
A \code{data.frame} 16 variables:
\describe{
\item{ViewName}{String of "Annual Donor Donation Made" (Chr).}
\item{RegistrationCode}{Unique code for each individual return (Chr).}
\item{ReturnId}{Unique code for each individual return (Int) -- It is not
clear why both this and \code{RegistrationCode} both exist but may
be for internal AEC use}
\item{ReturnTypeCode}{String of either "federaldonororganisation" or
"federaldonorindividual" (Chr).}
\item{ReturnTypeDescription}{String of either "Organisation Donor Return"
or "Individual Donor Return" (Chr).}
\item{ClientFileId}{Unique identifier of the party filing the return
(Int).}
\item{CurrentClientName}{Name that the donor filed the current return
under (Chr).}
\item{ReturnClientName}{Donor name that should be consistent across the
dataset (Chr).}
\item{DonationMadeToName}{Name of recipient of donation as written on
return (Chr).}
\item{DonationMadeToClientFileId}{ID of recipient (Int). This can be
joined with \code{ClientFileId} from \link{returns_party} to get
\code{PartyGroupName}, which is usually more useful than
\code{DonationMadeToName} in this table.}
\item{DonationMadeToClientType}{String of one of "politicalparty",
"politicalcampaigner", "thirdparty", "general", "associatedentity"
or "organisationdonor". Used to determine the appropriate dataset
to search for \code{ClientFileId} of recipient (Chr).}
\item{TransactionDate}{Date object of transaction date (Date). Note that
a small proportion of entries (around 100) do not include a date
(ie., the data will be \code{NA}), and filtering by date will
therefore exclude these entries.}
\item{Amount}{Donation amount in whole Australian dollars (Int).}
\item{FinancialRecordType}{A string of either "donationmade" or
"campaignerdonation" (Chr).}
\item{FinancialYear}{Financial year of the return in the format of
\code{YYYY-YY}.}
\item{DisclosurePeriodEndDate}{End date of the financial year as a date object (easier to use for plotting) (Date).}

\description{
Itemised details of receipts from political donors (1998-99 to 2020-21).
}
\details{
Part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 requires all donors to set
out the details of all receipts above the disclosure threshold each
financial year.

These details set out:

\itemize{
\item{the name of the person/entity that provided the funds}
\item{the address of the person/entity}
\item{the amount donated}
\item{the date on which the donation was made (however the date is missing for
unknown reasons in a very small proportion of the entries)}
}

All detailed receipts disclosed on political party, political campaigner
and associated entity returns from 1998-99 to 2018-19 are listed.

Note that recipients, who are identified by name (\code{CurrentClientName}
and \code{ReturnClientName}) or ID (\code{ClientFileId}), may or may not
be a political party, as indicated by \code{DonationMadeToClientType}. As
such matches may need to be made across one of a number of datasets
(\code{\link{returns_party}}, \code{\link{returns_campaigner}},
\code{\link{returns_thirdparty}} or \code{\link{returns_associatedentity}}).
